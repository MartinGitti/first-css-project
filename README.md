# first-css-project
<p>This project is my very first attempt to using Css to style my Html page.>/p>
<p>This project has two examples that we'll take a look at.</p>
<p>These Web Pages are standard HTML pages with a bit of css styling to them.</p>

## Web pages will display as follows:

Page example 1: 

<img src="Compulsory Task 1/screenshots-of-page/htmlPage1.JPG" alt="View of HTML page 1">
<img src="Compulsory Task 1/screenshots-of-page/htmlPage2.JPG" alt="View of HTML page 2">
<img src="Compulsory Task 1/screenshots-of-page/htmlPage3.JPG" alt="View of HTML page 3">

<hr/>

Page example 2:

<img src="Compulsory Task 2/screenshots-of-page/htmlPage1.JPG" alt="View of HTML page 1">
<img src="Compulsory Task 2/screenshots-of-page/htmlPage2.JPG" alt="View of HTML page 2">

## Use of code:
<p>Please feel free to make use of the code.</p>
<p>In order to use the code, open it via a browser once the files are on your local drive.</p>
<p>In order to edit the code, i'd recommend using text editor like Sublime Text or Visual Studio Code.</p>

<span>Happy Coding :sunglasses:</span>
