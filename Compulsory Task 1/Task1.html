	<h3>Here’s what you should know about Web 3.0</h3>
	<p>Posted by Hyperion Development</p>
	<p>
		The web as we know it, has changed dramatically since its earliest origins. We used AltaVista to browse some of
		the first websites that were published in Web 1.0. Later, we turned the sharing of content into a global
		culture, posting images, recording our own videos and contributing to huge information hubs online – no question
		was left unanswered. We called this version, Web 2.0. Now we’re talking about Web 3.0. In this post, we explore
		what Web 3.0 is, and why it matters.
	</p>

	<h3>What is Web 3.0?</h3>
	<p>
		As Daniel Nations explains, coming up with a definition for what Web 3.0 is, is a challenging task. One of the
		reasons for this, is that technically the origin of Web 3.0 cannot be pinned down to an exact date and time.
		Some would argue that technically Web 3.0 is already a reality, while others may argue that the transition from
		Web 2.0 is still a few years away. Either way, it’s difficult to define something that is intangible and without
		any defining parameters. What we can do towards finding some kind of workable understanding of Web 3.0, is look
		at its predecessors.
	</p>

	<p>
		Quite simply, as Nations suggests, Web 2.0 is an “interactive and social web facilitating collaboration between
		people.” We’ve seen the development of Web 2.0 reach benchmarks like the invention of social media, blogs, wikis
		and collaborative consumption platforms. This contrasts starkly with what we understand by the term Web 1.0,
		which can be defined as “a static information dump where people read websites but rarely interacted with them.”
		By definition then, Web 3.0 is the next generation in the evolutionary progression of the world wide web.
	</p>
	<h3>A Brief History of Web 2.0</h3>

	<p>
		Web 2.0 is characterised by “greater user interactivity and collaboration, more pervasive network connectivity
		and enhanced communication channels.” Traditionally, before Web 1.0 went mainstream, its usage was reserved for
		a select few – the few people who understood a bit about how the first search engines worked and the basic
		technology behind what was then called the “world wide web.”
	</p>

	<p>
		The evolution of Web 2.0 however, marked the onset of what many now refer to as the “sharing economy” or a more
		collaborative global community that uses the internet to share information and relay content in a more
		interactive and participatory way than was previously imagined. Web 2.0 can be associated with social networking
		sites like Facebook and Twitter, as well as user-generated content, like the information we see on blogs. It is
		also marked by the emergence of platforms that rely solely on the collaborative knowledge base of its users,
		like Wikipedia, as well as SaaS (Software as a Service), which includes web applications like Gmail, Dropbox and
		Slack.
	</p>
	<h3>A Snapshot of Web 1.0</h3>

	<p>
		Web 1.0 is largely thought of as the first stage in the development of the world wide web. Technopedia explains
		that generally speaking, Web 1.0 was a set of static websites that were not yet providing interactive content.
		These static websites provided users with no reason to return to the site other than to reread existing content.
		In Web 1.0, users had no influence over the site content and had no ability to interact with the site by leaving
		comments, making suggestions or sharing the content. Examples of Web 1.0 websites included Ask Jeeves and MSN
		messenger.

	<h3>What Does Web 3.0 Mean for the World?</h3>

	<p>
		Web 2.0 and the global culture of sharing content has led to the rise of important issues around web security
		and
		privacy. Founder of Essentia.one, Matteo Gianpietro Zago suggests that Web 2.0’s successor will be more
		human-centric: “Rather than concentrating the power (and data) in the hands of huge behemoths with questionable
		motives, it would be returned to the rightful owners.” So what will this change in direction mean for the web?
	</p>

	<p>
		Zago predicts that the power will be placed back in the hands of users who will have the security of encryption
		so that they can regain complete control of their own data. A further development might be the interoperability
		of applications – instead of only being able to run on one type of device, applications will be device-agnostic
		and able to run on smartphones, TVs, car operating systems and home appliances. In other words, “the internet of
		things” will become ever more interconnected.
	</p>

	<p>
		Whether it’s called Web 3.0 or another name, the fact that the next evolution of the web is imminent, is
		arguably
		undeniable. Exciting times lie ahead for the connected world as we redefine the parameters of a system that we
		have all contributed towards in one way or another. Now more than ever, the world needs devs who can drive the
		next evolution of the web as we apply the lessons we have learnt.
